# lncRNAeffects
In this branch, I'm planning to modify the code in lncRNA.py to perform simulations with a Dirichlet boundary conditions for mRNA, as suggested by Andriy. I'm hoping this would give rise to oscillations if the diffusion coefficient for the mRNA is much smaller compared to the diffusion coefficient of the protein.
