# lncRNAeffects

Stable code to perform phase field simulations with lncRNAs and transcriptional condensates.

The scripts/ directory contains the different scripts that you can run to perform different kinds of phase field simulations.
The Inputs/ directory contains input parameter files that different scripts in scripts/ take in to run simulations.
The Analysis/ directory contains code to make movies and perform other kinds of analysis on the data files generated from scripts and generate plots.
