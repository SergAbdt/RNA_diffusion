# lncRNAeffects

Stable code to perform phase field simulations with lncRNAs and transcriptional condensates.

1. The scripts/ directory contains the different scripts that you can run to perform different kinds of phase field simulations.
2. The Inputs/ directory contains input parameter files that different scripts in scripts/ take in to run simulations.
3. The Analysis/ directory contains code to make movies and perform other kinds of analysis on the data files generated from scripts and generate plots.
