#   Sets up free-energy related terms
#   fh is a flag for employing Flory-Huggins instead of double-well
#   changing_chi ,,2 uses the gaussian form & 1 ,, uses double-well LG expression
#   changing_chi ,,0 is not changing_chi and there for backwards compatability
#   rho_s/rho_r is height of double-well potential for protein/RNA respectively
#   kappa is surface tension parameter for protein, default , 0.5
#   chi is value of pairwise interaction
#   a,b,c are values of landau-ginzburg like three-way interaction & four way interactions
#   mu_r chooses whether you use D-R (mu_r,0) or chemical potential fo RNA (mu_r,1)
