# Parameters
# This line will not be read & similarly blank lines


# Initialization parameters
#   dimension is the number of dimensions of space
#   sparse determines whether to use the dense chromatin model (if 0) or the sparse chromatin model (if 1)
#   wall determines whether to add positive wall for low concentrations to the free energy expression (if 1)
#     (to escape negative concentrations and related numerical error bursts)
#   plot_flag determines whether to save plots of volume fractions at image control points (if 1, only works for 2D)
#   output_dir is directory to output data
